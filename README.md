# Stonks API Documentation

This is a cloud-hosted version of the Stonks API documentation, used in the [Webscraping](https://hackmd.io/@cs1951a/HJKPj_wjo) assignment for students running the service on the department machine.
It must be manually updated should the Stonks API change.
To do so,

1. Run the latest Stonks API locally.
1. Download https://localhost:8000/openapi.json and replace the current `openapi.json` in the repository with it.
1. Commit and push. The latest changes should be automatically reflected.
